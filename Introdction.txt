# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Elizabeth Aywaki. I am a pathways student interested in coding and technology. I enjoy learning new skills and collaborating on projects.

In my free time, I like to try new recipes and code. I am excited to use GitHub to share my work and learn from others.
